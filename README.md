# What is it ?

It's the source code of my cheat for escape from tarkov, include:
* Player ESP (Name, life, Scav AI/Player Scav/USEC/BEAR, and weapon (disabled by defaut cause some bug)
* Skillhack (Stamina, speed, throw distance and more)


# Why i released my source code

Because i was banned, the code is detected, so you need to rewrite the code and do not re-use names of: variables, class, method and namespace.
Obfuscate and create your own injector for stay undetected, but it's not 100% undetectable, i was banned 14 days after using the cheat, maybe because i was reported and the cheat is now detected.

# What injector i use ?

I use MInject library with my custom injector
